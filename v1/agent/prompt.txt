# Kubernetes Knowledge Graph Creation Task

## Objective
Create an ultra-dense, compact, highly structured Turtle (TTL) knowledge graph of Kubernetes knowledge that can be used to programmatically generate Kubernetes configurations from plain English conversations.

## Requirements

### 1. Knowledge Graph Structure
- Format: RDF/Turtle (.ttl)
- Must contain ALL Kubernetes concepts, relationships, and rules
- Each fact must have provenance (links to official docs)
- 100% accuracy required

### 2. Coverage Areas
- Core concepts (Pods, Deployments, Services, etc.)
- Networking (CNI, Ingress, Network Policies)
- Storage (PV, PVC, StorageClasses)
- Security (RBAC, PSP, Network Policies)
- Workload types (Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, CronJobs)
- Configuration (ConfigMaps, Secrets)
- Resource management (Limits, Requests, QoS)
- Scheduling (Affinity, Taints, Tolerations)
- Observability (Probes, Metrics, Logging)
- Multi-tenancy (Namespaces, Resource Quotas)
- API versions and compatibility
- Cloud provider integrations

### 3. Testing Requirements
- Test suite with dozens of test cases
- Format: RDF query â†’ expected YAML output
- Must validate 100% correctness
- Cover edge cases and complex scenarios

### 4. Supporting Documentation
- Example YAML files for different configurations
- Terraform examples
- Helm chart patterns
- Best practices documentation

### 5. Use Cases
The knowledge graph should support queries like:
- "Create a k8s cluster that hosts a web application with auto-scaling"
- "Set up a stateful database with persistent storage and backups"
- "Configure a microservices architecture with service mesh"
- "Implement zero-downtime deployments with rolling updates"
- "Set up multi-tenant isolation with network policies"

## Deliverables
1. `/agent/knowledge/kubernetes.ttl` - Main knowledge graph
2. `/agent/tests/` - Test queries and expected outputs
3. `/agent/examples/` - Example configurations
4. `/agent/docs/` - Supporting documentation
5. `/agent/validation/` - Validation scripts

## Process
1. Research official Kubernetes documentation
2. Extract concepts and relationships
3. Model in RDF/Turtle format
4. Add provenance links
5. Create test cases
6. Validate accuracy
7. Document patterns and best practices
